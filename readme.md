## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy of any project up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** (or yarn/pnpm) installed on your machine.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Anuragupadhayay/React_Projects.git](https://github.com/Anuragupadhayay/React_Projects.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the repository's main directory**:
    ```sh
    cd React_Projects
    ```

3.  **Choose a project** you want to run and navigate into its directory (example uses `05passwordgenerator`):
    ```sh
    cd 05passwordgenerator
    ```

4.  **Install the necessary NPM packages**:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

5.  **Start the development server**:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    *(Note: Some older projects might use `npm start`)*

The application will now be running on your local server, typically at `http://localhost:5173` or `http://localhost:3000`.
