# React Starter Project

This is my first React.js project. I'm currently learning React and using this repository to practice concepts and build small apps.

## 📁 Project Structure

This project was initialized using `create-react-app` (or Vite, if you're using that).

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
npm install
npm start
